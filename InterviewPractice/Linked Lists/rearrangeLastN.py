"""
Note: Try to solve this task in O(list size) time using O(1) additional space, since this is what you'll be asked during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers l and a non-negative integer n, move the last n list nodes to the beginning of the linked list.

Example

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 3, the output should be
rearrangeLastN(l, n) = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and n = 1, the output should be
rearrangeLastN(l, n) = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
