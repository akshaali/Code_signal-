You need to sum up a bunch of fractions that have different denominators. In order to do this, you need to find the least common denominator of all the fractions. As a professional programmer, you know that the least common denominator is in fact their LCM.

For the given list of denominators, find the least common denominator by finding their LCM.

Example

For denominators = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the output should be
leastCommonDenominator(denominators) = 60.

from fractions import gcd

def leastCommonDenominator(denominators):
    return functools.reduce(lambda x,y: (x*y)/(gcd(x,y)), denominators)
