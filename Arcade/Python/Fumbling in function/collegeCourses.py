""""
John has just entered a college, and should now pick several courses to take. He knows nothing, except that number x is a bad luck for him, which is why he won't even consider courses whose title consist of x letters.

Given a list of courses, remove the courses with titles consisting of x letters and return the result.

Example

For x = 7 and
courses = ["Art", "Finance", "Business", "Speech", "History", "Writing", "Statistics"],
the output should be
collegeCourses(x, courses) = ["Art", "Business", "Speech", "Statistics"].

""""

def collegeCourses(x, courses):
    def shouldConsider(course):
        return len(course) != x

    return list(filter(shouldConsider, courses))
