""""
To make debug output more understandable, you often separate sets of logs by a single line of the same character. Since you use this method very often, you'd like to write a function that would handle printing the separator.

Implement a function that, given a character ch and the number of times it should be repeated n, returns a string of n characters ch.

Example

For ch = '*' and n = 20, the output should be
repeatChar(ch, n) = "********************".
""""

repeatChar = lambda ch,n: ch*n
