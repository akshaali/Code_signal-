You decided to found your own startup company and now want to choose a proper name for it. There are three large companies that you want to compete against, and since their names are quite popular you want to use their names as a starting point. You want to use only popular characters in the name of your company, but not too mainstream. You consider a character to be popular if it appears in at least two company names, and consider it to be mainstream if it appears in all three.

Given the names of the companies, return the list of characters that are popular but not mainstream sorted by their ASCII codes.

Example

For companies = ["coolcompany", "nicecompany", "legendarycompany"],
the output should be
startupName(companies) = ['e', 'l'].

Here's how the answer can be obtained:

these letters appear in all three company names and are thus mainstream: 'a', 'c', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'y';
these letters appear only in one of the company names and are thus not popular: 'd', 'g', 'i', 'r';
the remaining letters are popular and not mainstream: 'e', 'l'.

def startupName(companies):
    cmp1 = set(companies[0])
    cmp2 = set(companies[1])
    cmp3 = set(companies[2])
    res = set(companies[0] + companies[1] + companies[2]) ^ (cmp1 ^ cmp2 ^ cmp3)
    return list(sorted(list(res)))
